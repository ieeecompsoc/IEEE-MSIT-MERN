                          IEEE MSIT has a pivitol role to play in advancing technological pursuits and social networking of
                          MSIT. Since it's inception in 2009, it has played a forward role in providing it's members a platform to
                          interact, collaborate and work towards a building a technically sound ecosystem. IEEE MSIT WIE, PES,
                          MTTS, CS chapters have worked in cohesion to explore and bring forth various engineering avenues
                          and opportunities such as hackathons, seminars, hands-on workshops, industrial visits, women
                          empowerment seminars, technical project exhibitions, STEP programmes and a lot more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The latest IEEE MSIT advent is it's AWP-PCB lab which is a project centric lab aiming at finding
                          hardware solutions to real world glitches faced by the institution as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          EEE MSIT plans to keep growing, directing, mentoring and spontaneously nurturing the budding
                          technologists of the institution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With TPE as it's major project exhibitory event, IEEE MSIT focusses on hardware and software
                          solutions and provides a ready platform for the budding engineers across the country to exhibit
                          their engineering prowess and put their skills to a judicious use. The exhibits are judged by a panel
                          of experienced judges who serve as able mentors to the students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With it's wide reach, IEEE MSIT serves as an ideal platform for the students to network, co-learn and
                          develop.
